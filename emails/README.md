## Send Timing Logic

### Recommended Schedule:
1. **Email 1:** Immediate (within 5 minutes of form submission)
2. **Email 2:** Day 3 (72 hours after submission)
3. **Email 3:** Day 7 (1 week after submission)
4. **Email 4:** Day 10 (or calculated based on deadline - send 5-7 days before deadline)
5. **Email 5:** Day 14+ (only if application not submitted)

### Conditional Send Rules:

**Stop sending if:**
- User submits application (move to different nurture sequence)
- User unsubscribes
- User marks emails as spam
- User clicks "not interested" link (if implemented)

**Adjust timing if:**
- Application deadline is less than 14 days away (compress schedule)
- User starts application (send Email 4 sooner with completion reminder)
- User books consultation (pause sequence temporarily)
